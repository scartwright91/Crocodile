# Crocodile Game Engine

*** Fixes
* Fragment shaders not compiling on laptop
* Sound emscripten (code to load wav/obj files)
* fullscreen / resizing

*** Improvements
* move to shared/unique pointers
* reduce complexity in Object class (especially position attributes)

*** Features
* 2d grid system + pathfinding
* Level editor (imgui)
* Logging
* Custom shaders (difficult)

1. Application should be able to change current scene: done
2. renderType enum should change to string so it can be easily extended
3. Make `renderObject` method virtual
4. Test
